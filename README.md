This example shows how to use the [NUCLEO-F446RE](http://www.st.com/web/catalog/tools/FM116/SC959/SS1532/LN1847/PF262063) development board with the [USB Host Shield library 2.0](https://github.com/felis/USB_Host_Shield_2.0).

The example project was created in [System Workbench for STM32](http://www.openstm32.org/System+Workbench+for+STM32) which is based on Eclipse.

I recommend using the [Mini variant of the USB Host Shield](http://shop.tkjelectronics.dk/product_info.php?products_id=45). In order to connect the Nucleo board you should follow the following [guide](https://www.circuitsathome.com/mcu/teensy-3-0-now-supported-by-the-usb-host-library).
